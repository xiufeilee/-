## Xiu-Fei Li
### Welcome! I am a PhD student major in theoretical physics and i studying in Beijing Normal University. I study theoretical cosmology and elementary particle physics. My research in these fields seeks to address some of the most exciting, persistent, and challenging problems in physics today.

## Research：
### My work addresses open questions in the study of theoretical cosmology by using the tools of elementary particle physics and particle astrophysics.  I am interested in understanding：
### 1. Why the universe contains more matter than antimatter and how we can test the physics of “baryogenesis” using high-energy particle collider experiments or astrophysical observations;
### 2. Why most of the particles in the universe are made of an ephemeral “dark matter,” how did it form, and what is its nature; 
### 3. What can we learn about the universe from measurements of gravitational waves.
